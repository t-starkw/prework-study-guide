# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage provides a one-stop-shop for studying coding bootcamp prework material. When studying new material, it is often difficult to organize what you've learned into manageable categories. Additionally, reviewing old material can seem like an overhwelming task when you're not sure where to start. The purpose of this study guide is to allow students to organize what they have learned into topics and to provide a starting point for reviewing these topics via a randomized study topic generator. This will help to resolve the anxiety associated with looking through messy, unorganized notes, as well as the difficulty of choosing a starting-place for studying a large amount of material. Throughout this project, I have learned how to develop and deploy a webpage, and have become more familiar with programming languages and the way in which they interact with one another to create an aesthetic and dynamic web page.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
